# Our Multi Metaverse

## What is it?

At the beginning, it just a very simple NFT minter in Discord(Before 20th Oct 2021, [check out here](https://github.com/ntb-hackthon/mars-asia-hackathon-2021) )

It just can setup one pinata key in discord, and mint NFT.

Now, it has a lot more features.

We try to build an SaaS platform to eliminate the gap between no-tech user and the web3.
Every discord server owner can have their own NFT SaaS solution here.

## ChainLink VRF useage: DiscordTicket

- [web ui](https://www.nfttop.best/guild/892687815656235068/buyTicket)

1. Buy ticket with any payment bigger than 0.05 matic.
2. 10 percentage of the payment will be send to one of the ticket owner.
3. The lucky owner is picked by random (by use the Chainlink VRF).
4. The early you buy the ticket, the luckier you will be!!
5. Only the user have the ticket can access our VIP channel!

## Code Link

<https://github.com/ntb-hackthon/hackthon-demo>

As the bot maybe develop as a SaaS later then so for now we do not public all the discord bot
code, we just share the code for the [pinata](https://github.com/ntb-hackthon/hackthon-demo/code-sample/pinata.js), [polygonMint](https://github.com/ntb-hackthon/hackthon-demo/code-sample/polygonMint.js), [bind wallet](https://github.com/ntb-hackthon/hackthon-demo/code-sample/bind-wallet.js).
